"""Web crawler core module.

Implements a three-stage crawl pipeline:

1. **Discover URLs** -- sitemap-first discovery (parses robots.txt for Sitemap
   directives, then recursively fetches sitemap XML).  Falls back to BFS link
   following when no sitemap is available.
2. **Fetch & clean content** -- downloads each page (optionally rendering JS
   via Playwright), strips navigation, footer, scripts, and other boilerplate,
   then extracts the main content region.
3. **Transform & persist** -- converts cleaned HTML to Markdown or plain text,
   deduplicates by content hash, writes individual files, and appends each
   page to a JSONL index (``pages.jsonl``).

The public entry point is :func:`crawl`, which orchestrates all three stages
and returns a :class:`CrawlResult`.

    """Derive an include_paths pattern from the seed URL.

    Returns a list with one glob like ``['/docs/transformers/*']`` when the
    seed has at least two path segments.  Returns ``None`` for root,
    single-segment, or article-style seeds (no scoping; preserve
    whole-site crawl behavior).

    Heuristic:
    1. If the seed's first segment is a known article-container (wiki,
       wikipedia, title), scope to ``/<container>/*``.  Articles are
       siblings under the container (e.g. ``/wiki/Foo`` and ``/wiki/Bar``),
       so the container *itself* is the right scope — not the seed path
       (which would block siblings) and not the whole host (which burns
       budget on ``/index.php``, ``/api.php``, etc. that mediawiki and
       similar platforms ship at the root).
    2. If the seed ends with a content-page filename (``something.html``,
       ``.htm``, ``.php``, ``.aspx``, ``.jsp``), drop the filename so the
       scope matches the parent *directory*.  Example:
       ``/stable/user_guide.html`` → scope at ``/stable/*`` so sibling
       pages like ``/stable/modules/...`` are reachable.
    3. Drop ``/index*`` if it remains.
    4. Use the resulting path + ``/*`` as scope when ≥ 2 path segments.

    This is the heuristic backing ``crawl(auto_path_scope=True)``.  It
    fixes the dominant coverage failure mode: BFS from a sub-section seed
    escapes to sibling sections (mdn /Web/CSS → /Glossary/, /blog/;
    HF /docs/transformers/ → /docs/sagemaker/, /blog/; ikea /us/en/cat/
    → /ee/en/, /de/de/) and burns the page budget on off-target pages.

    Orchestrates the full three-stage pipeline: URL discovery (sitemap-first,
    falling back to BFS link following), fetching and cleaning HTML, and
    writing Markdown/text files plus a JSONL index.

    Args:
        base_url: Seed URL and scope root (e.g. ``"https://example.com"``).
        out_dir: Directory where output files and ``pages.jsonl`` are written.
        use_sitemap: Attempt sitemap-based discovery before link following.
        delay: Politeness delay in seconds between requests (or batches).
        timeout: Per-request timeout in seconds.
        max_pages: Stop after saving this many pages (``0`` for unlimited).
        include_subdomains: Allow crawling subdomains of *base_url*'s host.
        fmt: Output format -- ``"markdown"`` or ``"text"``.
        show_progress: Print progress messages to stdout.
        min_words: Skip pages with fewer than this many words.
        user_agent: Custom User-Agent string; ``None`` uses the default.
        render_js: Use Playwright to render JavaScript before extraction.
        concurrency: Number of parallel fetch workers (``1`` for sequential).
        proxy: Optional HTTP/HTTPS proxy URL.
        resume: Resume a previously interrupted crawl from saved state.
        content_extractor: Optional custom function that takes raw HTML and
            returns a ``(title, content)`` tuple. When provided, this replaces
            the built-in extraction (html_to_markdown / html_to_text).
        extractor: Built-in extraction backend -- ``"default"`` (BS4 + markdownify),
            ``"trafilatura"`` (higher recall), or ``"ensemble"`` (runs both,
            picks best per page). Trafilatura options require
            ``pip install trafilatura``.
        exclude_paths: List of glob patterns to exclude by URL path
            (e.g. ``["/job/*", "/careers/*"]``).
        include_paths: List of glob patterns to *include* by URL path.
            When set, only URLs matching at least one pattern are crawled
            (e.g. ``["/blog/*", "/pricing"]``).  Exclude takes priority.
        dry_run: Only run URL discovery (sitemap + initial page links),
            print the URL list, and exit without fetching content.
        smart_sample: Auto-detect templated URL patterns and sample from
            large clusters instead of crawling every instance.
        sample_size: Number of pages to sample from each templated cluster
            (default: 5).  Only used when ``smart_sample=True``.
        sample_threshold: Clusters with more URLs than this are considered
            templated and sampled (default: 20).
        download_images: Download images from the content area and save
            to an ``assets/`` subdirectory.  Markdown output uses local
            paths instead of ``[Image: alt]`` placeholders.
        min_image_size: Minimum image file size in bytes (default: 5000).
            Smaller images (icons, spacers) are skipped.

    Returns:
        A :class:`CrawlResult` with the count of saved pages, output
        directory path, and path to the JSONL index file.
