"""Production cascade for render_js promotion decisions.

The cascade fires from cheap-and-precise to expensive-and-permissive,
short-circuiting on the first match. Each rule has a single
interpretable signal name so dispatch decisions are auditable.

This module is the production import point for `markcrawl.core`. The
benchmark harness in `bench/local_replica/methods.py` re-exports the
same primitives for autoresearch evaluation, so a rule that scores well
in the sweep behaves identically in production.

Cascade order (cheap → expensive):
  R0  user-set render_js          (authority signal, no scan needed)
  R1  is_spa=True                 (current heuristic, high precision)
  R2  class-gated thin seed       (apiref/docs/spa < threshold words)
  R3  HTML/text size ratio        (>50× ratio = JS shell; needs html bytes)

R4 (in-loop trip-wire after N static pages) was specified but
deliberately NOT shipped. The DS-6 autoresearch sweep on the v0.9.9
campaign labeled dataset (47 definite sites, 6 needs_render_js
positives) scored M3-trip-wire at 0% precision / 0% recall / 10.5%
FP-rate — strictly worse than chance. Adding R4 would degrade the
cascade (M6 with M3 vs M6 without). If reintroduced later, gate it
behind fresh sweep evidence; do not infer from intuition alone.

Each rule returns a `DispatchDecision` so the engine can log the rule
and signal that fired. Keep rule names stable — they're emitted in user
logs and parsed by external tooling.
